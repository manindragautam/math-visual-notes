<p><img alt="Subtracting Integers" src="../img/subtracting-integers.svg" /></p>
<p>Subtracting integers might seem like a new operation, but there's a clever trick that allows us to think of it in terms of addition, which we've already learned 4. The key idea is to convert every subtraction problem into an addition problem by "adding the opposite" 4. This means that when you see a subtraction, you keep the first number the same, change the subtraction sign to an addition sign, and then change the sign of the second number to its opposite 4. Once you've done this conversion, you can simply follow the rules for adding integers that we discussed in the previous chapter.</p>
<p>Let's break down some examples to see how this works 4.</p>
<p><strong>Example 1: -11 - 5</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Leave the first number unchanged: -11.  </li>
<li>Change the subtraction to addition: -11 + .  </li>
<li>Change the sign of the second number (5) to its opposite (-5): -11 + (-5).  </li>
<li>Now, we have an addition problem with two negative numbers. We add their absolute values (11 + 5 \= 16) and keep the negative sign. So, -11 + (-5) \= -16.  </li>
<li>Therefore, -11 - 5 \= -16.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example 2: -8 - (-12)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Leave the first number unchanged: -8.  </li>
<li>Change the subtraction to addition: -8 + .  </li>
<li>Change the sign of the second number (-12) to its opposite (12): -8 + 12.  </li>
<li>Now, we have an addition problem with different signs. We find the absolute values (|-8| \= 8 and |12| \= 12). We subtract the smaller from the larger (12 - 8 \= 4) and take the sign of the number with the larger absolute value (which is +12, so the result is positive). Thus, -8 + 12 \= 4.  </li>
<li>Therefore, -8 - (-12) \= 4.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Example 3: -29 - (-15)</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>Leave the first number unchanged: -29.  </li>
<li>Change the subtraction to addition: -29 + .  </li>
<li>Change the sign of the second number (-15) to its opposite (15): -29 + 15.  </li>
<li>Now, we have an addition problem with different signs. The absolute values are |-29| \= 29 and |15| \= 15. Subtracting the smaller from the larger gives 29 - 15 \= 14. The number with the larger absolute value is -29, so the result is negative. Therefore, -29 + 15 \= -14.  </li>
<li>Therefore, -29 - (-15) \= -14.</li>
</ol>
<p>Thinking about subtraction as "taking away" can sometimes be confusing, especially when dealing with negative numbers. The "add the opposite" rule provides a consistent and reliable method for solving any integer subtraction problem by converting it into a familiar addition problem. On the number line, subtracting a positive number is like moving to the left, and subtracting a negative number is like moving to the right, which aligns with the "add the opposite" rule (adding a negative moves left, and adding a positive moves right).</p>
<p><strong>Chapter 22: Multiplying Integers: Sign Matters!</strong></p>
<p>When it comes to multiplying integers, the sign of the result depends on the signs of the numbers being multiplied 5. There are specific rules that determine whether the product will be positive or negative.</p>
<p><strong>Rules for Multiplying Two Integers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Same Signs Result in a Positive Product:</strong> If both integers you are multiplying have the same sign (either both are positive or both are negative), then their product will be positive 5. For example, if you multiply a positive number by another positive number, the answer is positive. Similarly, if you multiply a negative number by another negative number, the answer is also positive. Consider these examples: (+3) x (+5) \= +15 and (-5) x (-8) \= +40 5.  </li>
<li><strong>Different Signs Result in a Negative Product:</strong> If the two integers you are multiplying have different signs (one is positive and the other is negative), then their product will be negative 5. It doesn't matter which number is positive and which is negative; as long as they have different signs, their product will be negative. Here are some examples: (+8) x (-9) \= -72 and (-12) x (13) \= -156 5.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Rules for Multiplying More Than Two Integers:</strong></p>
<p>When you need to multiply more than two integers together, you can extend these rules by focusing on the number of negative signs involved 5.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Even Number of Negative Signs Means a Positive Product:</strong> If, in the series of integers you are multiplying, there is an even number of negative signs, then the final product will be positive 5. For instance, in the example (-1) x (-6) x (-5) x (4) x (-2) \= 240, there are four negative numbers (an even number), so the result is positive 5. Each pair of negative numbers multiplied together yields a positive result, and when all the resulting positive numbers are multiplied, the final product remains positive.  </li>
<li><strong>Odd Number of Negative Signs Means a Negative Product:</strong> If there is an odd number of negative signs among the integers you are multiplying, then the final product will be negative 5. For example, in (-5) x (4) x (-2) x (-8) x (3) \= -960, there are three negative numbers (an odd number), so the result is negative 5. You can think of it as pairs of negative numbers making a positive, but with one negative number left over, which ultimately makes the product negative.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's important to always determine the sign of the product first when multiplying integers. Once you know the sign, you can then multiply the absolute values of the numbers to find the magnitude of the result.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 23: Exploring Exponents with Negative Bases</strong></p>
<p>Exponents tell us how many times to multiply a base number by itself. When the base number is negative, there are some important rules to remember, especially regarding the use of parentheses 6.</p>
<p><strong>Case 1: Negative base enclosed in parentheses</strong></p>
<p>When a negative base is enclosed in parentheses, the exponent applies to the entire base, including the negative sign 6. The outcome depends on whether the exponent is even or odd.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Even Exponent:</strong> If the exponent is an even number (like 2, 4, 6, etc.), the result will always be positive 6. This is because you are multiplying an even number of negative factors together, and as we learned in the previous chapter, a negative times a negative is a positive. For example, (-2)^2^ means (-2) multiplied by itself, which is (-2) x (-2) \= 4 6. Similarly, (-10)^4^ means (-10) x (-10) x (-10) x (-10) \= 10,000 6. Notice how the negative signs pair up to create positive results.  </li>
<li><strong>Odd Exponent:</strong> If the exponent is an odd number (like 1, 3, 5, etc.), the result will always be negative 6. This is because you will have an odd number of negative factors being multiplied. While pairs of negative factors will result in positive products, there will always be one negative factor left over, making the final product negative. For instance, (-5)^3^ means (-5) x (-5) x (-5) \= -125 6. Another example is (-4)^3^ \= (-4) x (-4) x (-4) \= -64 6.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Case 2: Negative sign not enclosed in parentheses</strong></p>
<p>When the negative sign is not enclosed in parentheses, the exponent only applies to the numerical base immediately following it 6. In this situation, the negative sign is treated as if you are taking the negative of the result of the exponentiation. Essentially, it's like multiplying by -1 after calculating the power. In this case, the result will always be negative, regardless of whether the exponent is even or odd 6.</p>
<p>Consider the example -2^2^. Here, the exponent 2 only applies to the number 2. So, first you calculate 2^2^, which is 2 x 2 \= 4. Then, you apply the negative sign in front, resulting in -4 6. This is the same as -1 x (2 x 2) \= -1 x 4 \= -4. Similarly, for -4^2^, you first calculate 4^2^ \= 4 x 4 \= 16, and then apply the negative sign to get -16 6. Even with an odd exponent, like in -4^3^, you first calculate 4^3^ \= 4 x 4 x 4 \= 64, and then apply the negative sign to get -64 6. So, -4^3^ is the same as -1 x 4^3^ \= -1 x 64 \= -64.</p>
<p>The presence or absence of parentheses makes a crucial difference when dealing with exponents and negative bases. Parentheses indicate that the entire negative number is the base being raised to the power, while their absence means only the positive numerical part is raised to the power, and the negative sign is applied afterwards. Paying close attention to this detail is essential for correctly evaluating expressions with negative bases and exponents.</p>

<li><strong>1.1 Divisibility Rules for 2 - 12</strong><br />
  Determining whether a number can be divided evenly by another number without performing the full division is a valuable skill in mathematics. These shortcuts, known as divisibility rules, are particularly useful in simplifying fractions and understanding number properties 1. GreeneMath.com's Pre-Algebra course covers these rules in Lesson #24, offering various learning methods 2.<br />
  A number is divisible by 2 if its last digit is 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. For instance, 346 is divisible by 2 because its last digit is 6. Divisibility by 3 can be checked by summing the digits of the number. If this sum is divisible by 3, then the original number is also divisible by 3. For example, with the number 513, the sum of the digits is 5 + 1 + 3 \= 9, and since 9 is divisible by 3, 513 is also divisible by 3. To check for divisibility by 4, one examines the number formed by the last two digits. If this two-digit number is divisible by 4, the entire number is divisible by 4. Consider 1724; the last two digits form 24, which is divisible by 4, so 1724 is divisible by 4. A number is divisible by 5 if its last digit is either 0 or 5, as seen in numbers like 230 and 785. Divisibility by 6 requires a number to be divisible by both 2 and 3. For example, 414 is even (divisible by 2) and the sum of its digits (4 + 1 + 4 \= 9) is divisible by 3, so 414 is divisible by 6.<br />
  The rule for divisibility by 8 involves the last three digits. If the number formed by these digits is divisible by 8, the whole number is divisible by 8. Take 9128; the last three digits form 128, which is divisible by 8, making 9128 divisible by 8. Similar to the rule for 3, divisibility by 9 is determined by the sum of the digits. If the sum is divisible by 9, the number itself is divisible by 9. For instance, in 729, the sum of the digits is 7 + 2 + 9 \= 18, which is divisible by 9, so 729 is divisible by 9. A number is divisible by 10 if its last digit is 0, such as 150 or 2890. Finally, divisibility by 12 requires a number to be divisible by both 3 and 4. Consider 636; the sum of its digits (6 + 3 + 6 \= 15) is divisible by 3, and the number formed by its last two digits (36) is divisible by 4, thus 636 is divisible by 12. These rules provide efficient methods for quickly assessing the divisibility of numbers.</li>

<li><strong>1.2 Factoring Whole Numbers</strong><br />
  Factoring is the process of finding the whole numbers that, when multiplied together, result in a given whole number 3. It can be thought of as the reverse of multiplication, or "un-multiplying" 4. For any whole number, the smallest factor is always 1, and the largest factor is the number itself 3. GreeneMath.com offers a lesson on factoring whole numbers as the 25th topic in its Pre-Algebra course 2.<br />
  Consider the number 18. Its factors are the whole numbers that divide 18 evenly. We know that 1 and 18 are factors because 1 × 18 \= 18 3. Checking other whole numbers between 1 and 18, we find that 2 × 9 \= 18, so 2 and 9 are factors. Similarly, 3 × 6 \= 18, making 3 and 6 factors. The whole numbers 4, 5, 7, 8, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, and 17 do not divide 18 evenly, so they are not factors. Therefore, all the factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18 3.<br />
  Factor pairs are simply two numbers that are multiplied together to get a specific number 5. For 18, the factor pairs are (1, 18), (2, 9), and (3, 6). Prime factorization is the process of breaking down a number into its prime factors, which are numbers greater than 1 that have only two factors: 1 and themselves 6. To find the prime factorization of 12, we can start by dividing by the smallest prime number, 2. 12 ÷ 2 \= 6. Then, we divide 6 by 2 again: 6 ÷ 2 \= 3. Since 3 is a prime number, we stop. The prime factors of 12 are 2, 2, and 3, which can be written as 2² × 3 6. Understanding factors and prime factorization is essential for simplifying fractions and working with other number theory concepts.  </li>
<li><strong>1.3 Finding the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)</strong><br />
  The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), also known as the Greatest Common Factor (GCF), of a group of numbers is the largest factor that is shared by all the numbers in that group 8. This concept is fundamental for simplifying fractions. GreeneMath.com includes a lesson on finding the GCD as the 28th topic in its Pre-Algebra course, within the "Fractions" section 2.<br />
  The process for finding the GCD involves three main steps 8. First, determine the prime factorization of each number. For example, to find the GCD of 40 and 60, we first find their prime factorizations. For 40, this is 2 × 2 × 2 × 5, or 2³ × 5. For 60, it is 2 × 2 × 3 × 5, or 2² × 3 × 5. Second, identify the prime factors that are common to all the numbers. In this case, both 40 and 60 share the prime factors 2 and 5. For factors that appear multiple times, include them only as many times as they appear in <em>all</em> of the prime factorizations. Here, 2 appears three times in the factorization of 40 and twice in the factorization of 60, so it is included twice in our list of common factors. The factor 5 appears once in both. The prime factor 3 is in the factorization of 60 but not 40, so it is not a common factor. Third, the GCD is the product of the common prime factors. For 40 and 60, the common prime factors are 2 × 2 × 5, which equals 20. Therefore, the GCD of 40 and 60 is 20 8.<br />
  Another example involves finding the GCD of 84, 140, and 168. The prime factorization of 84 is 2 × 2 × 3 × 7. For 140, it is 2 × 2 × 5 × 7. For 168, it is 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7. The prime factors common to all three are 2 and 7. The factor 2 appears twice in all three factorizations, and 7 appears once. Thus, the GCD is 2 × 2 × 7 \= 28 8. Understanding how to find the GCD is crucial for simplifying fractions to their simplest form.  </li>
<li><strong>1.4 Finding the Least Common Multiple (LCM)</strong><br />
  The Least Common Multiple (LCM) of a group of numbers is the smallest positive number that is a multiple of each of the numbers in the group 9. A multiple of a number is the product of that number and any nonzero whole number. Finding the LCM is essential when adding or subtracting fractions with different denominators. GreeneMath.com presents the lesson on finding the LCM as the 32nd topic within the "Fractions" section of its Pre-Algebra course 2.<br />
  There are two primary methods for finding the LCM: the listing method and the prime factorization method 9. The listing method involves writing out the multiples of each number until a common multiple is found. The smallest of these common multiples is the LCM. However, this method can be inefficient, especially for larger numbers. The prime factorization method is generally more practical 9. To use this method, first find the prime factorization of each number. For instance, to find the LCM of 21 and 45, the prime factorization of 21 is 3 × 7, and for 45, it is 3 × 3 × 5, or 3² × 5. Next, create a list containing each prime factor that appears in any of the factorizations. For factors that are repeated in multiple numbers, include the largest number of repeats found in any of the prime factorizations. In this case, the prime factors involved are 3, 7, and 5. The highest power of 3 is 3² (from 45), 7 appears once (from 21), and 5 appears once (from 45). Finally, the LCM is the product of these prime factors: 3² × 7 × 5 \= 9 × 7 × 5 \= 315. Therefore, the LCM of 21 and 45 is 315 9.<br />
  Consider finding the LCM of 6, 18, and 105. The prime factorization of 6 is 2 × 3. For 18, it is 2 × 3 × 3, or 2 × 3². For 105, it is 3 × 5 × 7. The prime factors involved are 2, 3, 5, and 7. The highest power of 2 is 2¹ (from 6 and 18). The highest power of 3 is 3² (from 18). The highest power of 5 is 5¹ (from 105). The highest power of 7 is 7¹ (from 105). The LCM is the product of these: 2 × 3² × 5 × 7 \= 2 × 9 × 5 × 7 \= 630. Thus, the LCM of 6, 18, and 105 is 630 9. Understanding the LCM is crucial for performing addition and subtraction of fractions with unlike denominators.</li>

<p><strong>Chapter 25: Introduction to Fractions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2.1 Introduction to Fractions</strong><br />
  A fraction is a way to represent a part of a whole 10. It indicates a quantity that is less than one whole but greater than zero 13. Fractions are written with one number over another, separated by a line 10. The top number is called the numerator, and it tells us how many parts of the whole we have 11. The bottom number is the denominator, which shows the total number of equal parts that the whole has been divided into 10. GreeneMath.com introduces fractions as the 26th lesson in its Pre-Algebra course, emphasizing a learn-practice-test approach 2.<br />
  For example, if a pizza is divided into eight equal slices and you take one slice, you have taken 1/8 (one-eighth) of the pizza. Here, 1 is the numerator (the number of slices you have), and 8 is the denominator (the total number of slices the pizza was divided into) 13. If you were to take two slices, you would have 2/8 (two-eighths) of the pizza 13. Fractions can also represent parts of a group. If you have a group of five sports balls, where one is a basketball and the other four are soccer balls, the fraction of the balls that are basketballs is 1/5 (one-fifth), because there is one basketball out of a total of five balls 12. The denominator indicates the total number of items in the group, and the numerator indicates the number of items we are referring to 12. Understanding the roles of the numerator and the denominator is fundamental to working with fractions.  </li>
<li><strong>2.2 Mixed Numbers &amp; Improper Fractions</strong><br />
  Mixed numbers and improper fractions are two different ways of representing quantities that are equal to or greater than one 14. An improper fraction is a fraction where the numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator 14. For instance, 5/3 and 7/4 are improper fractions. A mixed number is a combination of a whole number and a proper fraction (where the numerator is less than the denominator), such as 1 2/3 and 3 1/4 14. GreeneMath.com covers this topic in Lesson #27 of its Pre-Algebra course, providing resources for reading, watching, practicing, and testing 2.<br />
  It is often necessary to convert between these two forms. To convert an improper fraction to a mixed number, you divide the numerator by the denominator. The quotient (the result of the division) becomes the whole number part of the mixed number, and the remainder becomes the numerator of the fractional part, with the denominator staying the same 14. For example, to convert 7/3 to a mixed number, divide 7 by 3. The quotient is 2, and the remainder is 1. So, 7/3 is equal to the mixed number 2 1/3. To convert a mixed number to an improper fraction, you multiply the denominator of the fraction by the whole number and then add the numerator. This result becomes the new numerator, and the denominator remains the same 14. For instance, to convert 3 1/4 to an improper fraction, multiply 4 (the denominator) by 3 (the whole number) to get 12, and then add 1 (the numerator) to get 13. The improper fraction is therefore 13/4. The ability to convert between mixed numbers and improper fractions is crucial for performing arithmetic operations with fractions.  </li>
<li><strong>2.3 Simplifying Fractions</strong><br />
  Simplifying fractions means finding an equivalent fraction with a smaller numerator and denominator 15. Equivalent fractions are fractions that represent the same value, even though they may look different 15. A fraction is considered simplified if its numerator and denominator have no common factor other than 1 15. GreeneMath.com's Lesson #29 focuses on simplifying fractions, offering various learning tools 2.<br />
  One way to understand equivalent fractions is to consider that multiplying or dividing both the numerator and the denominator of a fraction by the same non-zero number does not change its value; it's essentially multiplying by 1 15. For example, 4/8 and 1/2 are equivalent fractions because if you divide both the numerator and the denominator of 4/8 by 4, you get 1/2. There are two main methods for simplifying fractions: factoring into prime numbers and dividing by the Greatest Common Factor (GCF) 15.<br />
  Using prime factorization, you factor both the numerator and the denominator into their prime factors and then cancel out any common factors. For example, to simplify 12/18, the prime factorization of 12 is 2 × 2 × 3, and the prime factorization of 18 is 2 × 3 × 3. The common factors are 2 and 3. Canceling these out leaves (2 × 3)/(3 × 3) \= 2/3. Alternatively, you can find the GCF of the numerator and the denominator and divide both by it. For 12 and 18, the GCF is 6. Dividing both by 6 gives 12 ÷ 6 \= 2 and 18 ÷ 6 \= 3, resulting in the simplified fraction 2/3 15. Simplifying fractions makes them easier to work with and understand.  </li>
<li><strong>2.4 Comparing Fractions</strong><br />
  Comparing fractions involves determining which of two or more fractions represents a larger quantity 16. This skill is important for ordering fractions and understanding their relative values. GreeneMath.com covers this in Lesson #34, providing resources for various learning styles 2.<br />
  One common method for comparing fractions is by finding the Least Common Denominator (LCD) 16. The LCD is the smallest common multiple of the denominators of the fractions being compared. Once the fractions have the same denominator, you can easily compare their numerators; the fraction with the larger numerator is the larger fraction 16. For example, to compare 3/4 and 5/6, the LCD of 4 and 6 is 12. Converting both fractions to have a denominator of 12, we get 3/4 \= 9/12 and 5/6 \= 10/12. Since 10/12 is greater than 9/12, we know that 5/6 is greater than 3/4.<br />
  Another rule applies when comparing fractions with the same numerator: the fraction with the smaller denominator is the larger fraction 16. For instance, 2/3 is greater than 2/5 because both have a numerator of 2, and 3 is smaller than 5. A third method involves using cross products 16. To compare two fractions, a/b and c/d, you multiply the numerator of the first fraction by the denominator of the second (a × d) and the numerator of the second fraction by the denominator of the first (b × c). If a × d &gt; b × c, then a/b &gt; c/d. If a × d \&lt; b × c, then a/b \&lt; c/d. If a × d \= b × c, then a/b \= c/d. For example, comparing 3/4 and 5/6, we have 3 × 6 \= 18 and 4 × 5 \= 20. Since 18 \&lt; 20, we know that 3/4 \&lt; 5/6 17. Understanding these methods allows for effective comparison of fractional quantities.</li>

<li><strong>3.1 Multiplying Fractions</strong><br />
  Multiplying fractions is a straightforward operation that involves multiplying the numerators together to get the new numerator and multiplying the denominators together to get the new denominator 18. GreeneMath.com presents this topic as Lesson #30 in its "Fractions" section, offering various resources for learning 2.<br />
  For example, to multiply 1/2 by 2/3, you multiply the numerators (1 × 2 \= 2) and the denominators (2 × 3 \= 6), resulting in the fraction 2/6 19. This fraction can then be simplified to 1/3 by dividing both the numerator and the denominator by their greatest common factor, 2. It's important to note that when multiplying fractions, you do not need a common denominator 18. Multiplying by a fraction can be thought of as taking a part of another part 19. For instance, if you have half a pizza and you take one-third of that half, you are performing the multiplication 1/3 × 1/2 \= 1/6, meaning you have one-sixth of the whole pizza. When multiplying more than two fractions, you simply extend the process: multiply all the numerators together and all the denominators together. For example, 1/2 × 4/3 × 3/5 \= (1 × 4 × 3) / (2 × 3 × 5) \= 12/30, which simplifies to 2/5 19. After multiplying, it's often necessary to simplify the resulting fraction to its lowest terms 18.  </li>
<li><strong>3.2 Dividing Fractions</strong><br />
  Dividing fractions involves a process of transforming the division problem into a multiplication problem by using the reciprocal of the divisor 22. GreeneMath.com covers this in Lesson #31, providing comprehensive learning materials 2.<br />
  The first step in dividing fractions is to find the reciprocal of the second fraction (the divisor). The reciprocal of a fraction is obtained by interchanging its numerator and denominator; in other words, you "flip" the fraction 22. For example, the reciprocal of 3/4 is 4/3. The reciprocal of a whole number, say 5, is found by first writing it as a fraction 5/1 and then flipping it to get 1/5 22. Once you have the reciprocal of the second fraction, you keep the first fraction unchanged, change the division operation to multiplication, and then multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second fraction 22. For example, to divide 1/2 by 3/4, you keep 1/2, change the division to multiplication, and multiply by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3. So, the problem becomes 1/2 × 4/3 \= (1 × 4) / (2 × 3) \= 4/6, which simplifies to 2/3. When dividing a fraction by a whole number, or vice versa, you first write the whole number as a fraction with a denominator of 1 and then follow the same procedure. For instance, to divide 2/5 by 3, you write 3 as 3/1, find its reciprocal 1/3, and then multiply: 2/5 × 1/3 \= 2/15 22.  </li>
<li><strong>3.3 Adding &amp; Subtracting Fractions</strong><br />
  Adding and subtracting fractions requires that the fractions have a common denominator 23. This means that the bottom numbers of the fractions must be the same. GreeneMath.com addresses this in Lesson #33 of its Pre-Algebra course, offering various learning resources 2.<br />
  If the fractions already have a common denominator, you simply add or subtract the numerators and keep the same denominator 23. For example, to add 2/7 and 3/7, since they have the same denominator, you add the numerators: 2 + 3 \= 5. The sum is 5/7. Similarly, to subtract 5/9 from 7/9, you subtract the numerators: 7 - 5 \= 2. The difference is 2/9. If the fractions have different denominators, you must first find a common denominator 24. The most efficient common denominator to use is the Least Common Denominator (LCD), which is the least common multiple of the denominators. For example, to add 1/3 and 1/2, the LCD of 3 and 2 is 6. You convert each fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 6: 1/3 \= 2/6 and 1/2 \= 3/6. Then, you add the numerators: 2/6 + 3/6 \= 5/6. A shortcut for adding or subtracting two fractions, a/b and c/d, is to multiply diagonally for the new numerators (ad and bc) and multiply the denominators for the new denominator (bd). So, a/b + c/d \= (ad + bc) / bd, and a/b - c/d \= (ad - bc) / bd 26. For example, 1/3 + 1/2 \= (1×2 + 1×3) / (3×2) \= (2 + 3) / 6 \= 5/6.  </li>
<li><strong>3.4 Operations with Mixed Numbers</strong><br />
  Performing arithmetic operations with mixed numbers often involves first converting them to improper fractions, especially for multiplication and division 29. GreeneMath.com's lesson on operations with mixed numbers was inaccessible at the time of this report 32, so external resources are used here.<br />
  To multiply mixed numbers, begin by converting each mixed number to an improper fraction 29. For example, to multiply 2 1/2 by 3 1/4, first convert them to improper fractions: 2 1/2 \= (2×2 + 1)/2 \= 5/2, and 3 1/4 \= (3×4 + 1)/4 \= 13/4. Then, multiply the improper fractions: 5/2 × 13/4 \= (5×13) / (2×4) \= 65/8. Finally, you can convert the result back to a mixed number if desired: 65/8 \= 8 1/8 29. The same principle applies to division. Convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions and then multiply the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second 29.<br />
  For adding and subtracting mixed numbers, you have two main options 29. One way is to convert the mixed numbers to improper fractions, perform the addition or subtraction as with regular fractions (ensuring a common denominator), and then convert the result back to a mixed number. Another method is to add or subtract the whole number parts and the fractional parts separately. When doing this, you will need to find a common denominator for the fractional parts. For example, to add 3 1/4 and 2 1/3, you can add the whole numbers (3 + 2 \= 5) and then add the fractions (1/4 + 1/3 \= 3/12 + 4/12 \= 7/12), giving a result of 5 7/12. If subtracting, you may need to borrow from the whole number part to perform the subtraction of the fractions if the fraction being subtracted is larger 29.  </li>
<li><strong>3.5 Complex Fractions</strong><br />
  A complex fraction is a fraction that contains one or more fractions in its numerator, its denominator, or both 34. GreeneMath.com's Lesson #38 covers the simplification of complex fractions 34.<br />
  There are two primary methods for simplifying complex fractions. The first method involves simplifying the numerator and the denominator separately until each becomes a single fraction. Then, the complex fraction can be simplified by multiplying the numerator by the reciprocal of the denominator (essentially dividing the two simplified fractions) 34. For example, consider the complex fraction (1/2 + 1/3) / (3/4 - 1/6). First, simplify the numerator: 1/2 + 1/3 \= 3/6 + 2/6 \= 5/6. Then, simplify the denominator: 3/4 - 1/6 \= 9/12 - 2/12 \= 7/12. Now, the complex fraction becomes (5/6) / (7/12), which is simplified by multiplying 5/6 by the reciprocal of 7/12, which is 12/7: (5/6) × (12/7) \= 60/42. This can be further simplified by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common factor, 6, resulting in 10/7.<br />
  The second method, often considered faster, involves finding the Least Common Denominator (LCD) of all the fractions within the complex fraction. Then, you multiply both the numerator and the denominator of the complex fraction by this LCD 34. Using the same example, (1/2 + 1/3) / (3/4 - 1/6), the fractions involved are 1/2, 1/3, 3/4, and 1/6. The LCD of 2, 3, 4, and 6 is 12. Multiplying the entire numerator (1/2 + 1/3) by 12 gives (1/2 × 12) + (1/3 × 12) \= 6 + 4 \= 10. Multiplying the entire denominator (3/4 - 1/6) by 12 gives (3/4 × 12) - (1/6 × 12) \= 9 - 2 \= 7. So, the simplified complex fraction is 10/7 34.</li>

<p><strong>Chapter 27: Ratios, Rates, and Proportions</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>4.1 Ratios &amp; Rates</strong><br />
  A ratio is a comparison of two numbers or quantities that have the same units 35. It can be expressed in several ways, such as using a colon (3:5), as a fraction (3/5), or with words ("3 to 5") 37. A rate, on the other hand, compares two quantities that can have different units, such as miles per hour or dollars per pound 35. GreeneMath.com covers "Ratios &amp; Rates" as the 35th topic in its Pre-Algebra course 2.<br />
  For example, if a fruit stand sells five apples for every three oranges, the ratio of apples to oranges is 5 to 3, which can also be written as 5:3 or 5/3 38. This ratio indicates the relationship between the number of apples and the number of oranges sold. A rate often involves a period of time in the denominator, such as 40 miles per hour, which is a rate comparing distance (miles) to time (hours) 38. This can be written as 40 miles/1 hour. A unit rate is a rate where the second quantity (usually in the denominator) is one unit 35. For example, if Jake earns $80 for every 4 hours he works, his unit rate of pay is $20 per hour (80 dollars / 4 hours \= 20 dollars / 1 hour) 40. Unit rates are particularly useful for comparing different rates. For instance, if one car travels 120 miles in 3 hours (a rate of 40 miles per hour) and another travels 150 miles in 5 hours (a rate of 30 miles per hour), comparing their unit rates easily shows that the first car is traveling faster 38.  </li>
<li><strong>4.2 Proportion Definition</strong><br />
  A proportion is an equation that states that two ratios or two rates are equal 17. For example, if the ratio of apples to oranges at one fruit stand is 5:3 and at another stand it is 10:6, these two ratios are proportional because 5/3 is equal to 10/6. GreeneMath.com defines proportion in Lesson #36 of its Pre-Algebra course 2.<br />
  A key property of proportions is that the cross products are equal 17. For a proportion a/b \= c/d, this means that a × d \= b × c. This property can be used to test if two ratios form a proportion and to solve for an unknown value in a proportion. For example, to check if 3/4 \= 9/12 is a proportion, we calculate the cross products: 3 × 12 \= 36 and 4 × 9 \= 36. Since the cross products are equal, the ratios form a proportion. Proportions have many real-world applications, including scaling recipes up or down 17. If a recipe calls for 2 cups of flour for every 1 cup of sugar, and you want to double the recipe, you can set up a proportion: 2 cups flour / 1 cup sugar \= x cups flour / 2 cups sugar. Using cross products, 2 × 2 \= 1 × x, so x \= 4. You would need 4 cups of flour. Understanding proportions allows for solving problems involving equivalent ratios and rates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 28: Decimals</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>5.1 Decimal Fractions</strong><br />
  A decimal fraction is a fraction whose denominator is a power of 10, such as 10, 100, 1000, and so on 41. These fractions can be easily represented as decimal numbers, which use a decimal point to separate the whole number part from the fractional part 41. GreeneMath.com's lesson on decimal fractions was inaccessible for this report 45, so external resources are used.<br />
  The place value of the digits to the right of the decimal point indicates the denominator of the decimal fraction. The first digit to the right of the decimal point is in the tenths place (denominator of 10), the second digit is in the hundredths place (denominator of 100), the third is in the thousandths place (denominator of 1000), and so on 42. For example, the decimal 0.1 represents the fraction 1/10, and the decimal 0.25 represents the fraction 25/100 44. To convert a decimal fraction to a decimal number, you simply write the numerator and place the decimal point such that the number of digits after the decimal point is equal to the number of zeros in the denominator. For example, 75/100 becomes 0.75, and 19/10 becomes 1.9 43. Conversely, to convert a decimal number to a decimal fraction, you write the number without the decimal point as the numerator, and the denominator is a power of 10 with as many zeros as there are decimal places in the original number. For instance, 0.42 becomes 42/100 41. Understanding decimal fractions is crucial for working with decimal numbers and their relationship to common fractions.  </li>
<li><strong>5.2 Comparing &amp; Rounding Decimals</strong><br />
  Comparing decimals involves determining which of two or more decimal numbers has a greater value 47. Rounding decimals is the process of approximating a decimal number to a nearby value with fewer decimal places 48. GreeneMath.com's lesson on comparing and rounding decimals was inaccessible for this report 53, so external resources are used.<br />
  To compare decimals, first line up the decimal points vertically 47. Then, compare the digits in each place value from left to right, starting with the ones place and moving towards the right. If the digits in a particular place value are different, the decimal with the larger digit in that place value is the larger number. If the digits are the same, move to the next place value to the right 47. You can use placeholder zeros at the end of a decimal to help align the digits and make the comparison clearer 49. For example, to compare 0.5 and 0.34, lining them up gives:<br />
  0.50<br />
  0.34<br />
  Comparing the tenths place, 5 is greater than 3, so 0.5 is greater than 0.34 47.<br />
  To round a decimal to a specific place value, first identify the digit in the rounding place 48. Then, look at the digit immediately to the right of the rounding place. If this digit is 5 or greater, round up the digit in the rounding place by adding 1. If the digit to the right is less than 5, keep the digit in the rounding place the same (round down) 48. For example, to round 3.75 to the nearest tenth, the rounding place is the tenths place (7). The digit to the right is 5, so we round up the 7 to 8, resulting in 3.8 48. If we wanted to round 3.73 to the nearest tenth, the digit to the right of 7 is 3, which is less than 5, so we would round down, keeping the 7 the same, resulting in 3.7 51.  </li>
<li><strong>5.3 Adding &amp; Subtracting Decimals</strong><br />
  Adding and subtracting decimals is similar to adding and subtracting whole numbers, with the key step of aligning the decimal points 54. GreeneMath.com's lessons on adding and subtracting decimals were inaccessible for this report 59, so external resources are used.<br />
  To add or subtract decimals, first, write the numbers vertically, making sure to line up the decimal points 54. You can add zeros as placeholders to the right of the decimal point if needed to make the numbers have the same number of decimal places; this can help with alignment and avoid errors 54. Once the decimal points are aligned, perform the addition or subtraction as you would with whole numbers, starting from the rightmost digit and moving to the left, carrying or borrowing as necessary 54. Finally, place the decimal point in the answer directly below the decimal points in the numbers being added or subtracted 54.<br />
  For example, to add 0.275 and 5.35, we write them as:<br />
    0.275<br />
  + 5.350  (added a placeholder zero)<br />
  -------<br />
    5.625</li>
</ul>
<p>To subtract 3.46 from 32.1, we write them as:<br />
   32.10  (added a placeholder zero)<br />
  -  3.46<br />
  -------<br />
   28.64</p>
<p>The alignment of the decimal points ensures that you are adding or subtracting digits with the same place value (tenths with tenths, hundredths with hundredths, etc.).<br />
<em> </em><em>5.4 Multiplying Decimals</em><em><br />
  Multiplying decimals involves a process similar to multiplying whole numbers, but with an additional step to place the decimal point in the product correctly 60. GreeneMath.com's Lesson #42 covers multiplying decimals 60.<br />
  The first step is to multiply the decimal numbers as if they were whole numbers, ignoring the decimal points 60. For example, to multiply 3.48 by 1.27, you would first multiply 348 by 127. The result is 44196 54. The next step is to determine the placement of the decimal point in the product. To do this, count the total number of decimal places in both of the original numbers (the factors). In our example, 3.48 has two decimal places, and 1.27 has two decimal places, for a total of four decimal places. The product must have the same number of decimal places. Starting from the rightmost digit of the product (44196), count four places to the left and place the decimal point. So, 3.48 × 1.27 \= 4.4196 54.<br />
  There is a shortcut for multiplying a decimal by 10 or a power of 10. To multiply by 10, you move the decimal point one place to the right. To multiply by 100, you move it two places to the right, and so on. For example, 734.582 × 1000 \= 734582.0 (the decimal point moved three places to the right) 54. Understanding these rules allows for accurate multiplication involving decimal numbers.<br />
</em> <strong>5.5 Dividing Decimals</strong><br />
  Dividing decimals requires careful attention to the placement of the decimal point in both the divisor and the dividend 61. GreeneMath.com's Lesson #43 explains the process of dividing decimals 61.<br />
  When dividing a decimal by a whole number, you set up the long division as usual. The decimal point in the quotient (the answer) is placed directly above the decimal point in the dividend. Then, you perform the division as if both numbers were whole numbers. For example, to divide 12.5 by 5, you would set up the long division and place the decimal point in the quotient above the one in 12.5. Then, you divide 125 by 5, which is 25. Placing the decimal point correctly gives 2.5.<br />
  When the divisor is a decimal, you need to make it a whole number before performing the division. To do this, you move the decimal point in the divisor to the right until it is at the end of the number, making it a whole number. You must also move the decimal point in the dividend the same number of places to the right. You may need to add zeros to the end of the dividend as placeholders if you run out of digits. Once the divisor is a whole number, you can perform the long division as described above, placing the decimal point in the quotient directly above the new position of the decimal point in the dividend. For example, to divide 0.54 by 1.2, you first move the decimal point in 1.2 one place to the right to get 12. You then move the decimal point in 0.54 one place to the right to get 5.4. Now, you divide 5.4 by 12, which results in 0.45 54. Dividing by powers of 10 involves moving the decimal point in the dividend to the left by the number of zeros in the power of 10. For example, 237.36 ÷ 1000 \= 0.23736 (the decimal point moved three places to the left) 54.<br />
<em> </em><em>5.6 Changing Fractions to Decimals</em>*<br />
  Converting a fraction to a decimal involves performing the division indicated by the fraction: dividing the numerator by the denominator 62. GreeneMath.com's lesson on changing fractions to decimals was inaccessible for this report 67, so external resources are used.<br />
  If the fraction is a proper fraction (numerator less than denominator), the decimal will be less than 1. If it's an improper fraction (numerator greater than or equal to denominator), the decimal will be greater than or equal to 1 63. If you have a mixed number, you can either convert it to an improper fraction first and then divide, or you can divide the fractional part and add it to the whole number part 62.<br />
  For example, to convert 1/8 to a decimal, you divide 1 by 8. This results in 0.125 66. To convert 2/5 to a decimal, you divide 2 by 5, which gives 0.4 65. Sometimes, the division results in a terminating decimal (like 0.125 or 0.4), where the decimal ends after a certain number of digits. Other times, it results in a repeating decimal, where one or more digits repeat indefinitely. For example, to convert 1/3 to a decimal, you divide 1 by 3, which gives 0.333... (the 3 repeats). This can be written as 0.3 with a bar over the 3 65. Fractions whose denominators are powers of 10 (like 10, 100, 1000) can be easily converted to decimals by simply moving the decimal point in the numerator to the left by the number of zeros in the denominator. For example, 57/100 is 0.57 68.</p>
<h4 id="chapter-29-percentages-and-basic-statistics"><strong>Chapter 29: Percentages and Basic Statistics</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>6.1 Percentages</strong><br />
  A percentage is a way of expressing a number as a fraction of 100, meaning "per cent" or "out of one hundred" 69. The symbol "%" is used to denote percentage. GreeneMath.com's Lesson #45 covers the topic of percentages 69.<br />
  To convert a fraction to a percentage, you can follow a few methods. If the denominator of the fraction is already 100, then the numerator is simply the percentage. For example, 35/100 is 35%. If the denominator is not 100, you can try to convert the fraction to an equivalent fraction with a denominator of 100. For instance, to convert 1/4 to a percentage, you can multiply both the numerator and the denominator by 25 to get 25/100, which is 25%. Another method is to divide the numerator by the denominator to get a decimal, and then multiply the decimal by 100 (which is equivalent to moving the decimal point two places to the right). For example, to convert 3/5 to a percentage, divide 3 by 5 to get 0.6, and then multiply by 100 to get 60% 69.<br />
  To convert a decimal to a percentage, you simply multiply the decimal by 100 (move the decimal point two places to the right and add the "%" symbol). For example, 0.75 is equal to 75%, and 1.25 is equal to 125% 69. To convert a percentage to a decimal, you divide the percentage by 100 (remove the "%" symbol and move the decimal point two places to the left). For example, 80% is equal to 0.80, and 150% is equal to 1.50 69. When multiplying with percentages, it's usually best to convert the percentage to a decimal first. For example, to find 20% of 50, you would convert 20% to 0.20 and then multiply by 50: 0.20 × 50 \= 10 69. Percentages greater than 100 indicate a value that is more than the whole, often used to describe increases 69.  </li>
<li><strong>6.2 Mean, Median, &amp; Mode</strong><br />
  Mean, median, and mode are three common measures of central tendency used to describe the "average" or typical value in a set of numbers 70. GreeneMath.com's Lesson #46 explains how to calculate these measures 70.<br />
  The mean, often referred to as the average, is calculated by adding up all the numbers in the set and then dividing by the total number of values 70. For example, to find the mean of the numbers 5, 8, and 11, you would add them together (5 + 8 + 11 \= 24) and then divide by the count, which is 3 (24 ÷ 3 \= 8). So, the mean is 8.<br />
  The median is the middle value in a set of numbers that are arranged in order from least to greatest 70. If there is an odd number of values, the median is the single middle number. For example, in the set 3, 7, 9, the median is 7. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. For example, in the set 2, 4, 6, 8, the two middle numbers are 4 and 6. Their average is (4 + 6) ÷ 2 \= 5, so the median is 5.<br />
  The mode is the number or numbers that appear most frequently in a set of data 70. A set of numbers can have one mode, more than one mode (if multiple numbers appear with the same highest frequency), or no mode (if all numbers appear with the same frequency). For example, in the set 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, the mode is 2 because it appears twice, which is more than any other number. In the set 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, there are two modes, 2 and 3, because both appear twice. In the set 1, 2, 3, 4, all numbers appear once, so there is no mode 70.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 30: Measurement</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>7.1 Converting between U.S. Units</strong><br />
  Converting between different units of measurement within the U.S. customary system requires knowing the relationships between these units 71. GreeneMath.com's Lesson #47 covers conversions for weight, length, volume, and time 71.<br />
  A useful tool for performing these conversions is the unit fraction, which is a fraction equal to 1 that expresses the relationship between two units. For example, since there are 12 inches in a foot, the unit fractions 12 inches / 1 foot and 1 foot / 12 inches are both equal to 1. To convert a quantity from one unit to another, you multiply by the unit fraction that has the desired unit in the numerator and the unit you want to cancel out in the denominator. For example, to convert 5 feet to inches, you would multiply 5 feet by the unit fraction 12 inches / 1 foot: 5 feet × (12 inches / 1 foot) \= 60 inches (the "feet" units cancel out) 71.<br />
  Conversions may sometimes require multiple steps. For example, to convert ounces to tons, you would first convert ounces to pounds (since there are 16 ounces in a pound) and then convert pounds to tons (since there are 2000 pounds in a ton) 71. Similarly, converting gallons to pints might involve first converting gallons to quarts (4 quarts in a gallon) and then quarts to pints (2 pints in a quart) 71.</li>

  The metric system is a decimal system of measurement, which means that conversions between units are based on powers of 10, making them relatively straightforward 73. GreeneMath.com's lesson on converting between metric units was inaccessible for this report 76, so external resources are used.<br />
  The metric system uses prefixes to indicate the relationship between a unit and its base unit. The base units commonly used are the meter (for length), the gram (for mass or weight), and the liter (for volume or capacity) 73. Prefixes such as kilo (k) mean 1000 times the base unit (e.g., 1 kilometer \= 1000 meters), centi (c) mean 1/100 of the base unit (e.g., 1 centimeter \= 0.01 meters), and milli (m) mean 1/1000 of the base unit (e.g., 1 millimeter \= 0.001 meters) 73.<br />
  Converting between metric units involves moving the decimal point to the right when converting from a larger unit to a smaller unit (equivalent to multiplying by a power of 10) and to the left when converting from a smaller unit to a larger unit (equivalent to dividing by a power of 10) 72. The number of places you move the decimal point corresponds to the power of 10 difference between the units. For example, to convert 3 meters to centimeters, you move the decimal point two places to the right (since centi is 10⁻² and there's a difference of 10² between meters and centimeters), resulting in 300 centimeters 74. To convert 500 meters to kilometers, you move the decimal point three places to the left (since kilo is 10³), resulting in 0.5 kilometers 75.</li>
