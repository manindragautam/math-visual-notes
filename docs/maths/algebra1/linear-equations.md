        $$
        6 \cdot \frac{x}{2} + 6 \cdot \frac{1}{3} = 6 \cdot \frac{5}{6} \implies 3x + 2 = 5
        $$
        $$
        3x = 3 \implies x = 1
        $$

-   **Example 2 (Decimal Equation)**:

        $$
        $$
        3x = 6 \implies x = 2
        $$

-   **Example 6 (Decimal Equation)**:
