# **Fractions**

## Chapter 27: Introduction to Fractions

### Definitions

-   **Fraction**: Represents part of a whole (a/b where a = numerator, b = denominator)
-   **Numerator**: Top number (parts being considered)
-   **Denominator**: Bottom number (total equal parts)
-   **Proper Fraction**: Numerator < denominator (e.g., 3/4)
-   **Unit Fraction**: Numerator = 1 (e.g., 1/2)

### Visual Representation

```mermaid
pie title 1/5 Attendance
    "Work From Office" : 20
    "Work From Home" : 80
```

### Examples

1. **Identifying Parts**

    - Problem: What fraction of a 12-slice pizza remains if 5 slices were eaten?
    - Solution:
        - Eaten: 5/12
        - Remaining: (12-5)/12 = 7/12

2. **Group Fraction**

    - Problem: In a box of 24 crayons, 5 are broken. What fraction is usable?
    - Solution:
        - Usable: (24-5)/24 = 19/24

3. **Visualizing Fractions**
    - Problem: Shade 3/5 of a rectangle
    - Solution:
        ```mermaid
        graph LR
        A[Whole Rectangle] --> B[Divide into 5 columns]
        B --> C[Shade 3 columns]
        ```

### Key Takeaways

## Chapter 28: Mixed Numbers & Improper Fractions

### Definitions

-   **Improper Fraction**: Numerator ≥ denominator (e.g., 5/3)
-   **Mixed Number**: Whole number + proper fraction (e.g., 1 2/3)
-   **Conversion**: Process of changing between forms

### Conversion Methods

| Conversion Type  | Steps                           | Example                |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Improper → Mixed | Divide numerator by denominator | 7/3 = 2 R1 → 2 1/3     |
| Mixed → Improper | Whole × denominator + numerator | 3 1/4 = (3×4)+1 = 13/4 |

### Examples

1. **Improper to Mixed**

    - Problem: Convert 11/4 to mixed number
    - Solution:
        - 11 ÷ 4 = 2 R3
        - Result: 2 3/4

2. **Mixed to Improper**

    - Problem: Convert 5 2/7 to improper fraction
    - Solution:
        - (5 × 7) + 2 = 37
        - Result: 37/7

3. **Application Problem**
    - Problem: A recipe calls for 3/2 cups sugar. Express as mixed number.
    - Solution:
        - 3 ÷ 2 = 1 R1
        - Result: 1 1/2 cups

### Key Takeaways

> -   Mixed numbers are easier for measurement interpretation
> -   Improper fractions are better for calculations
> -   Conversion skills essential for fraction operations
> -   Whole numbers can be written as fractions (e.g., 3 = 3/1)

## Chapter 29: Simplifying Fractions

### Definitions

-   **Simplest Form**: No common factors between numerator/denominator except 1
-   **GCF**: Greatest Common Factor
-   **Equivalent Fractions**: Different fractions representing same value

### Simplification Methods

1. **GCF Method**:

    - Find GCF of numerator/denominator
    - Divide both by GCF

2. **Prime Factorization**:
    - Factor completely
    - Cancel common factors

### Examples

1. **Using GCF**

    - Problem: Simplify 18/24
    - Solution:
        - GCF of 18 & 24 = 6
        - 18÷6 / 24÷6 = 3/4

2. **Prime Factorization**

    - Problem: Simplify 36/60
    - Solution:
        - 36 = 2²×3²
        - 60 = 2²×3×5
        - Cancel common factors: (2²×3)/(2²×3×5) = 3/5

### Key Takeaways

> -   Simplified fractions are easier to work with
> -   Always check for common factors
> -   Final answer should be in simplest form
> -   Essential for comparing fractions

## Chapter 30: Comparing Fractions

### Comparison Methods

| Common Denominator   | Different denominators | 1/3 vs 1/4 → 4/12 vs 3/12 |
| Cross-Multiplication | Any fractions          | 2/3 vs 3/5 → 10 vs 9      |
| Same Numerator       | Numerators equal       | 3/8 vs 3/5 → 3/5 larger   |

### Examples

1. **Using LCD**

        - 15/18 > 14/18

2. **Cross-Multiplication**

    - Problem: Compare 3/7 and 4/9
    - Solution:
        - 3×9 = 27
