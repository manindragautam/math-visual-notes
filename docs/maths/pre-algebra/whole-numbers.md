## Chapter 1: Place Value: Understanding the Value of Digits

### Definitions

-   **Place Value**: The value of a digit based on its position within a number. Each position represents a power of 10.
-   **Digits**: The symbols 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 used to represent numbers.
-   **Ones Place**: The rightmost digit in a number, representing units.
-   **Tens Place**: The second digit from the right, representing groups of ten.
-   **Hundreds Place**: The third digit from the right, representing groups of one hundred.
-   **Thousands Place**: The fourth digit from the right, representing groups of one thousand.

### Place Value Chart

A place value chart organizes digits according to their place, starting from the ones place on the right and moving left:

| Thousands | Hundreds | Tens | Ones |
| --------- | -------- | ---- | ---- |
| 1         | 2        | 3    | 4    |

In the number 1,234:

-   The digit **1** is in the thousands place, representing 1,000.
-   The digit **2** is in the hundreds place, representing 200.
-   The digit **3** is in the tens place, representing 30.
-   The digit **4** is in the ones place, representing 4.

### Examples

-   **Example 1**: Identify the place value of the digit 7 in 573.

    -   **Solution**: The digit 7 is in the tens place, so its value is \(7 \times 10 = 70\).

-   **Example 2**: Write the number 8,529 in expanded form.

    -   **Solution**:
        $$
        8,529 = (8 \times 1000) + (5 \times 100) + (2 \times 10) + (9 \times 1)
        $$

-   **Example 3**: What is the value of the digit 4 in 4,321?

    -   **Solution**: The digit 4 is in the thousands place, so its value is \(4 \times 1000 = 4000\).

-   **Example 4**: Write the number 6,042 in expanded form.

    -   **Solution**:
        $$
        6,042 = (6 \times 1000) + (0 \times 100) + (4 \times 10) + (2 \times 1)
        $$

-   **Example 5**: Identify the place value of the digit 0 in 10,506.

    -   **Solution**: The digit 0 is in the hundreds place, so its value is \(0 \times 100 = 0\).

-   **Example 6**: Write the number 12,345 in expanded form.
    -   **Solution**:
        $$
        12,345 = (1 \times 10,000) + (2 \times 1000) + (3 \times 100) + (4 \times 10) + (5 \times 1)
        $$

### Key Takeaways

> -   Place value determines the value of a digit based on its position in a number.
> -   Each position to the left represents a value ten times greater than the position to its right.
> -   Zero acts as a placeholder to maintain the correct place value of other digits.
> -   Expanded form breaks down a number into the sum of each digit multiplied by its place value.

## Chapter 2: Expanded Form: Breaking Down Numbers

### Definitions

-   **Expanded Form**: A way to write numbers by breaking them down into the sum of each digit multiplied by its place value.
-   **Standard Form**: The usual way of writing numbers (e.g., 123).

### Examples

-   **Example 1**: Write 345 in expanded form.

    -   **Solution**:
        $$
        345 = (3 \times 100) + (4 \times 10) + (5 \times 1)
        $$

-   **Example 2**: Write 1,208 in expanded form.

    -   **Solution**:
        $$
        1,208 = (1 \times 1000) + (2 \times 100) + (0 \times 10) + (8 \times 1)
        $$

-   **Example 3**: Write 50,607 in expanded form.

    -   **Solution**:
        $$
        50,607 = (5 \times 10,000) + (0 \times 1000) + (6 \times 100) + (0 \times 10) + (7 \times 1)
        $$

-   **Example 4**: Convert \( (2 \times 1000) + (3 \times 100) + (4 \times 10) + (5 \times 1) \) to standard form.

    -   **Solution**:
        $$
        2,000 + 300 + 40 + 5 = 2,345
        $$

-   **Example 5**: Write 9,001 in expanded form.

    -   **Solution**:
        $$
        9,001 = (9 \times 1000) + (0 \times 100) + (0 \times 10) + (1 \times 1)
        $$

-   **Example 6**: Convert \( (7 \times 10,000) + (0 \times 1000) + (8 \times 100) + (0 \times 10) + (9 \times 1) \) to standard form.
    -   **Solution**:
        $$
        70,000 + 0 + 800 + 0 + 9 = 70,809
        $$

### Key Takeaways

> -   Expanded form breaks down a number into the sum of each digit multiplied by its place value.
> -   It reinforces the concept of place value and helps in understanding the structure of numbers.
> -   Zero is explicitly included in expanded form to show its role as a placeholder.
